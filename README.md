What is this?
-------------

I made a simple app which manages your grocery list (in reminders, so it syncs with reminders and uses reminders as the storage location for the grocery list).

Here’s a (now pretty old) comparison screenshot:

I wrote it in swift, to learn swift, which has [gone quite well](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:2908+[swift]) so far.

There’s more about it on [the website](http://dailybread.jiaaro.com), which is also where you can **request beta access** if you just want to try it out.

If you really don’t care and just want to know when it’s in the App Store:  
[send me an email](requestingdailybreadlaunchnews@jiaaro.com). 

I'll add you to the list =D

I used Apple’s new(ish) programming language [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), along with the excellent [PaintCode](http://www.paintcodeapp.com), and a lot of help from `Google+Stack Overflow` (which for these purposes I consider to be a single unit ;)
