          Hi, I’m James.
          <img src="img/selfie.jpg" class="sidebar">
        </p>

        <p>My wife, Tara, and I made an app.</p>

        <p>I think it’s pretty good, but we’ll get to the app in a second.</p>

        <p>First, let me tell you a little story.</p>

        <p>
          For a long time Tara and I shared a grocery list using the built-in 
          “Reminders” app that is pre-installed on our iPhones.
        </p>

        <p>We used it because it was already installed, and it worked.</p>

        <p>
          <img src="img/reminders.png" class="sidebar">
          It’s backed up to iCloud, and we could use it from our iPhones, iPads, Macs, 
          and iCloud.com. Pretty Sweet!
        </p>

        <p>Just have two complaints:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>I’ve typed “yogurt” into our grocery list more than twenty times</li>
          <li>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve come back from the grocery store only to realize I forgot to buy bagels</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          What am I supposed to do? Lather a piece of wheat bread with cream cheese? 
          I’m not an animal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes Tara would look through the “completed” items to see if 
          there was anything we should buy again and uncheck them, re-adding those things 
          to the list. It kind of sucked though because there are hundreds (thousands?) of 
          completed items in the grocery list.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wouldn’t it be great if the things we’ve bought the most times were up at the 
          top? Wait! I’m professional sorter and aggregator of lists! Maybe I can sort 
          <em>this</em> list. (<b>note:</b> The actual sorting in Daily Bread is smarter 
          than that now – it takes into account the time since you last purchased as well —Tara)
        </p>

        <p>
          Only problem is: I don’t want to use a <em>new</em> grocery app, and have to 
          start fresh. I want to sort <em>this</em> list. That we’ve been using for years. 
          That’s already shared via iCloud.
        </p>

        <p>So that’s what we did.</p>

        <p>
          Daily Bread focuses on the fundamentals. Most of us buy pretty much the same 10 
          groceries every week. That’s why the screen for adding a grocery shows the 
          most common items.
          <img src="img/dailybread.png" class="sidebar">
        </p>

        <p>
          And you can just tap to add a grocery to the list. 
          No Typing!<a id="astx1" class="astx"></a>
          I don’t care how good the new iOS 8 keyboards are. No keyboard is better
          than no keyboard at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          And since it syncs with Reminders you can keep using your existing grocery
          list. You can still use iCloud.com. You don’t have to convince anyone else 
          to install the app or mess around with sharing a new list. And you can switch 
          back to using Reminders at any time (but you won’t want to)!
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, and you can use Siri: “Add eggs to my grocery list<a id="astx2" class="astx"></a>”
        </p>

        <p>Making a grocery list should be quick and easy, and now it is.</p>

            Unless you’re adding one of those “once in a while” 
            things to the list
          </aside>
          <aside id="fn2">
            Assuming the list is called “grocery” otherwise you’ll have to use the name 
            you used for the list. For example if you call your list “daily bread”
            it would be “add eggs to my daily bread list”
